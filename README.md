# Permit NextJS Dashboard

![Admin dashboard](image.png)

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a Next.js application, inspired by the Permit.io integration. It showcases how different user roles (admin, editor, viewer) can have varying levels of access to features in an admin dashboard.
